# COMP2000 Milestone 2
## Description
The COMP2000 project focused on enhancing the existing codebase through the application of object-oriented programming techniques and design patterns. The goal is to refine the software's architecture, improve efficiency, and ensure adherence to the principles of good object-oriented design.

## Tasks Accomplished
- Codebase Analysis and Refactoring: Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing codebase, identifying and rectifying inefficiencies. The refactoring efforts were aimed at improving the code structure and its maintainability without altering the software's external behavior.
- Enhanced Code Readability: Streamlined the code to increase readability and maintainability. This included removing redundant code, utilizing meaningful naming conventions, and organizing the code into logically coherent modules.
- Design Pattern Integration: Integrated suitable design patterns to address various software design problems. This approach not only made the code more robust and flexible but also facilitated easier future enhancements and bug fixes.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Ensured all modifications, especially those involving design patterns and structural changes, were well-documented. The documentation provides clear and concise explanations, making it easier for future developers to understand the rationale behind each decision.
- Custom Exception Handling: Developed custom exceptions to provide more specific error handling, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the application.
- Performance Optimization: Identified and optimized performance bottlenecks, ensuring that the application runs more efficiently. This involved optimizing algorithms, reducing unnecessary computations, and enhancing the overall responsiveness of the software.
- Bug Identification and Resolution: Conducted extensive testing to identify and fix bugs. This process not only improved the application's stability but also its overall user experience.
